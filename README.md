# simple-fastApi-server
 A simple fastapi server with js frontend to make requests

 For installing fastapi and dependencies, run either command 1 or 2:

 1. `pip install fastapi[all]`
 2. `pip install -r req.txt`

 For running the server, run `uvicorn main:app --reload`

 Open index.html in a browser and keep updating the variables inside the driverFunction() to make different types of requests. Alternatively, head on to `http://localhost:8000` in a browser and can make requests directly from there as well.
